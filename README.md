# Python2024
I have a background in industrial chemistry, MS Excel and MS PowerPoint but am an IT enthusiast. In an age driven by advancements in IT tools and applications, equipping myself with a vaeity of IT skills would not only make professionally valuable, but also allow me to thrive at a personal level while fulfilling my passion. A personal space for practicing Python programming from beginner level towards mastery level, and later combine with data science and analysis. I feel excited whenever I deal with numbers, and doing this using coding would be amazing. Big data analytics, machine learning, Python, R, SQL, and artificial intelligence are my targeted areas. I believe with consistent working on a daily basis, all these skills can be earned. Thank you, and let's meet at the top. Life is too short to write bad code!
